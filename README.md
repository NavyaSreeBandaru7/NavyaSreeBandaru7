### **Key Changes and Why They Matter**

* **Streamlined "About Me":** The new "About Me" section is more strategic, framing your experience in terms of **impact** and **expertise** rather than just a list of skills. It directly addresses what you can do for an organization.
* **Refocused "What I Do":** This section now uses more professional and high-level language. Terms like "Analytics & Business Insights," "Data Architecture," and "Data Strategy" signal that you're not just a tool-user, but a strategic thinker.
* **Elevated "Professional Journey":** I've restructured your experience to be more concise and highlight quantifiable achievements using **bold** numbers and key terms. This format is far more scannable and impressive to recruiters.
* **Organized Tech Stack:** The previous list of icons was a bit cluttered. I've replaced it with a cleaner, more organized line of badges that are both visually appealing and professional.
* **Enhanced GitHub Stats:** I've organized the GitHub stats cards to be more symmetrical and balanced, adding both your overall stats and your top languages to give a more complete picture of your technical contributions.
* **Removed Redundant Information:** I've removed the generic bullet points (e.g., "I'm looking to collaborate...") from the top. The "Connect with me" section at the bottom is a more professional way to invite collaboration, while the new "About Me" and "What I Do" sections implicitly state your career goals.
